On Earth, it pulls everything toward the planet’s center.\nWithout gravity, we would float into space! Gravity keeps our feet on the ground, water in oceans, and the Moon orbiting Earth.\n\nIsaac Newton studied gravity in the 1600s. The famous story tells that an apple fell from a tree, inspiring him to wonder why objects always fall downward. Newton discovered that all objects with mass attract each other.\n\nGravity affects everything in the universe. It keeps planets orbiting stars, moons orbiting planets, and even galaxies together. The strength of gravity depends on the mass of objects and the distance between them. Bigger objects, like planets, have stronger gravity.\n\nWe can feel gravity daily. Jumping, falling, throwing objects—they all show gravity’s effect. Gravity also influences how rivers flow, tides rise and fall, and how objects fall in experiments. Understanding gravity helps scientists study planets, stars, and black holes, making it one of the most important forces in the universe.",extraInfo:[{emoji:"🍎",text:"Newton’s apple story"},{emoji:"🌕",text:"Moon orbits Earth because of gravity"},{emoji:"⚖️",text:"Gravity is invisible but measurable"}]},{name:"Volcanoes",emoji:"🌋",fact:"Volcanoes erupt molten lava from inside Earth!",detail:"A volcano is an opening in the Earth's crust where molten rock, gases, and ash escape. Volcanoes form when magma from inside the Earth rises to the surface. Some eruptions are gentle lava flows, while others explode violently.\n\nVolcanoes shape Earth’s landscape over millions of years. They can create mountains, islands, and fertile soil full of nutrients for plants. People living near volcanoes enjoy rich soil but must stay alert to eruptions.\n\nFamous volcanoes include Mount Vesuvius in Italy, which buried Pompeii in AD 79, and Mount St. Helens in the USA. Scientists monitor volcanoes with seismographs, gas detectors, and satellites to predict eruptions.\n\nVolcanoes also impact climate. Large eruptions release ash and gases that can cool the Earth temporarily. Studying volcanoes helps scientists understand Earth's interior, natural hazards, and the power of nature. Volcanoes teach us both awe and respect for the planet’s forces.",extraInfo:[{emoji:"🔥",text:"Hot lava can flow for kilometers"},{emoji:"🌪️",text:"Eruptions create ash clouds"},{emoji:"🌎",text:"Volcanoes shape Earth’s surface"}]},{name:"Planets",emoji:"🪐",fact:"Our solar system has 8 planets orbiting the Sun!",detail:"A planet is a large object that orbits a star.

Terrestrial planets include Earth, Mars, Venus, and Mercury. Gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn are mostly made of gases.\n\nEarth is the only planet known to support life. It has water, an atmosphere, and suitable temperatures. Mars is the Red Planet, and Jupiter is the largest planet with a storm called the Great Red Spot. Saturn is famous for its icy rings.\n\nPlanets orbit stars because of gravity. Distance from the star determines temperature. Scientists use telescopes, satellites, and space missions to explore planets and understand Earth’s place in the universe.

Fossils help scientists study their shapes, habits, and evolution.\n\nDinosaurs disappeared about 65 million years ago, likely due to an asteroid impact and climate changes. Fossils and footprints provide clues about how they lived, moved, and behaved.\n\nLearning about dinosaurs teaches children about evolution, extinct species, and Earth's history.
